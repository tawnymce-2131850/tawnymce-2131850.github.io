            <h2>Tangled</h2>
            <p><img src = "tangled.jpg" title = "Tangled" style = "width:200px; margin-left:5px;">Tangled is my #1 favorite Disney movie because the characters, songs, and plot are supurb to say the least. It is about a princess who was kidnapped at birth by an evil witch and forced to live in a tower in solitude for her whole childhood. On her 18th birthday, she set out on an adventure to see the "floating lights" that appear every year on her birthday. She meets loyal friends and finds out the truth about her past. </p>

        <div id = "Moana">
            <h2>Moana</h2>
            <p><img src = "moana.jpg" title = "Moana" style = "width:200px; margin-left:5px;">Moana is my #2 favorite Disney movie because the plot is really intersting and the songs are catchy. It's about a girl who goes on a mission to get the heart of Te Fiti to save her island. She meets a Maui, a demigod and he helps her save her island</p>
        </div>

        <div id = "Frog">
            <h2>The Princess Frog</h2>
            <p><img src = "princessfrog.jpg" title = "The Priness Frog" style = "width:200px; margin-left:5px;">The Princess Frog is my #3 favorite Disney movie because I really like the songs and the plot as well. It's about this girl named Tiana whoo gets turned intoa frog by a prince and they get stuck in a swamp trying a find a way to become human again in time for Tiana to get her restaurant.</p>
